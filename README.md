# espn-curl
Login to ESPN and grab protected content using cUrl


This project allow users to automatically grab ESPN protected content using cUrl.

You have put your real username/password.

You may also need to change your API_KEY, normally the same API_KEY for me is working two months untill now and was no need to update it. 
But in case you need to update it you can easy find your API_KEY on Inspect Element.

Script can be customized as you need it, so in case you want to modify it and grab only i part of the protected content. 
You will find it very easy to do that, since the script is easy to customize!
